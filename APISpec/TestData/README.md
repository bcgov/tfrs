TFRS - Generating/Loading Test Data
======================

Overview
--------
This folder contains reference and test data for the TFRS application and a mechanism for managing and generating the reference and test data files. Reference data is read-only data that is loaded into all instances of the application (Dev, Test and Prod) - status values, type lists, etc. Test data is fake data in the correct format to be loaded into the Dev and/or Test instances of the application for use in testing the system. Note that some tables - such as the Fuel Supplier data might be both - used for testing on Dev and Test and used as the seed data going into production.

Managing/Creating the Data
---------------------
The data is maintained in the _TFRS Data Generation.xlsm_ Excel file in the "in" folder. It has a series of tabs in it, and each one with a ".csv" extension is exported from the excel and used to drive the data generation process.  The test data itself is a combination of static data and formulas to generate data (e.g. random dates, values, etc.) and joins between tables. There is also a table of fake names and addresses to use for people/users in the system.

A VB Excel macro, invoked with the key combination Ctrl-Shift-V, exports all of the csv files in one step. Use the macro every time you update the test data.

Once exported, use the "gendata.bat" or "gendata.sh" scripts to generate the JSON files that make up the test data. The JSON files are (or should be) compatible with the "bulk" operations generated from the Swagger API. Loaded in the correct order, they will initialize the data to a proper state.

Loading the Test Data
----------------
Once the data is generated, pairs of scripts (.bat and .sh scripts) are used to load the data via the API.  The load scripts have been used in another project but have not yet been used for TFRS with live APIs and may require some tweaking.

The "load.*" script takes as arguments:

* a JSON file
* an "bulk" API endpoint
* a server URL (literal dev, test or prod or a full URL)

and loads the data into the application using the given endpoint.  The load.* script includes a commented out call to authenticate the user with the application and create a cookie for the subsequent call to actually load the data. The authenticate call is expected to only be called if the "cookie" file does not exist.

The "load-all.*" script takes just the server as an argument (same format as load.*) to be loaded and loads in relational appropriate order all of the tables to initialize the application. Again - it has not yet been run with live api's and may need further tweaking. The load-all script removes the "cookie" file if it exists so that on only the first call to the load script, the (currently commented out) authentication call will be made to the server.
