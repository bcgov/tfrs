/postgresql-backup is mounted to both 9.5 and 9.6 pod, it is shared pvc "RWX (Read-Write-Many)"

* 1. oc project to the environment project

* 1.5 login to Keycloak to verify if there are any active user sessions

* 2. manually delete autoscalers for both client and tfrs but need to write down the configurations as we need to add them back later on

* 3. scale down both client and tfrs to 0

* 4 login current postgresql 9.5 pod and run command to back up all the data
pg_dump tfrs | gzip > /postgresql-backup/SQLDump/dev/tfrs-dev-20181214-122400.gz
pg_dump tfrs | gzip > /postgresql-backup/SQLDump/test/tfrs-test-20181217-103500.gz

* 5. scale down postgresql to 0

* 6. run below oc command to create a new PVC and new postgresql 9.6 deployment config
oc process -f ./postgresql96.dc.json PVC_SIZE=5Gi | oc create -f -
Verify if a new PVC postgresql96-cns and a new dc postgresql96 have been created sucessfully.
also the new pod of posgresal96 should have been up and running before going to next step

* 7. login the new postgresql 9.6 pod and run below command to restore all the data from backup
gunzip -c /postgresql-backup/SQLDump/dev/tfrs-dev-20181214-122400.gz | psql tfrs
gunzip -c /postgresql-backup/SQLDump/test/tfrs-test-20181217-103500.gz | psql tfrs

* 8. modify service postgresql, set selector name to postgresql96 to choose 9.6 pod

* 9. scale tfrs and client to 1 pod

* 10. add autoscaler back for tfrs and client

11. The PVC/postgresql-cns and DC/postgresql for Postgresql 9.5 need to be kept for a week or so before deleting it
