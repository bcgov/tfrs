# this is a highly minimalist installation of CrunchyDB, capable of fitting inside a very small namespace.
# testing shows it works comfortably for a small dataset under light load.
# it is very likely that you will need to tune up some of these values to suit the needs of your application,
# but this is a good starting place to get your DB up and functioning - from here, you increase each resource as you require.
