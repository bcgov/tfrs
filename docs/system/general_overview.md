# General Overview

### Code
The backend REST API is wrtten in Python (Django) and the frontend is written in JavaScript ES6 which is transpiled by babel through webpack.

Some pre-compiled css and js libraries are used from the [Gov 2.0 Bootstrap Skeleton](https://github.com/bcgov/Gov-2.0-Bootstrap-Skeleton)

Apart from unit tests, we also have function and UI tests that are using the [BDD Stack](https://github.com/BCDevOps/BDDStack) on BCGov DevOps.
