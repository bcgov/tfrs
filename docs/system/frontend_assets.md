Assets
-------
All assets are located in the `public/` folder.

`public/assets/` contains files that are not written in react or directly part of the application itself. These are images, and other css/js files that are part of the BC Gov Theme (Bootstrap skeleton), as well as other third-party libraries.

`public/build` are the files generated when you build the TFRS application using webpack.

`index.html` is the initial (and only) HTML page that gets loaded when you access the application.
