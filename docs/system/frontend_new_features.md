Developing new features
------------------
It is recommended that new features should adhere to the architectural decisions discussed in this documentation (see [contributing](../system/frontend_contributing.md))

We are in the process of deprecating older code, most of which do not have separate presentational & container components, so please avoid writing in that style for new code.
