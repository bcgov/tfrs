# TFRS
Transportation Fuels Reporting System

## Usage
Facilitates online Fuel Reporting and Low Carbon Fuel credit transfers supporting BC's market-based approach to avoiding lifecycle GHG emissions from transportation fuel.  

- Fuel suppliers buy and sell low carbon fuel credits
- Government approves credit transfers and tracks balances
- Government awards credits for infrastructure projects
- Government validates credits from the supply of low carbon fuels
