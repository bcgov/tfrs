TFRS Wireframes
---------------

The TFRS Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). At the time of writing, the up to date wireframe project file  for TFRS can be found on the TFRS network drive.

V2 of the wireframes were created in October, expanding on known requirements and clarifying details from internal users. The wireframes are not ready for usability testing at this time. If usability testing is to be conducted on the wireframes, interactivity will be added to the project and the updated output will be posted.
